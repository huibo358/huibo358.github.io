# Task 1.9: Markdown

## Headers

Header 1 is in the very first line. Header 2 is right above this line.

### This is H3

#### This is H4

##### This is H5

###### And here is H6

## Lists

I'm a fan of lists. They make things easier to read.

  2. Un
  3. Deux
  4. Trois
  
## Tables

Tables are a bit harder to do. 

But | They | Are | Neat | Too 
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
But | Still, | Lists | Are | Much
Better | And | Easier| ! | :)

## Links

Links are always helpful, and can lead to many great things.

Here are some doggos. Enjoy.
